<h2>1. What is Fix My Kythera Trails? What is its purpose?</h2>
<p>Fix My Kythera Trails is: </p>
<ul>
<li>a web service made available to the public - both residents and visitors - to report issues encountered along the hiking trails in Kythera, thereby simplifying maintenance and problem resolution. </li>
<li>an aid to geolocating the reports</li>
<li>A tool to inform the public and the responsible entities at each key stage in the handling of the issue. </li>

</ul>
<p>Fix My Kythera Trails is a Smart Solution realised through the EU-funded project Futural by initiative of the Kytherian Foundation for Culture &amp; Development (KIPA) and developed by the Lisbon Council. </p>
<h2>2. What can I report?</h2>
<p>You can report any incident, i.e. something that is not working as expected along the hiking trails known as Kythera Trails, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Litter or unsanitary conditions</li>
<li>Poor conditions of guiding / informational signage</li>
<li>Unsafe condition of the path: slippery surface, erosion, etc. </li>
<li>Presence of obstacles on a trail</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition to strictly speaking incidents, users can also report </p>
<ul>
<li>the status of hydrological infrastructure (so-called micro-dams) present along some of the trails</li>
<li>observations related to wildlife sightings.</li>

</ul>
<h2>3. Which areas are covered?</h2>
<p>Fix My Kythera Trails can only be used along the trails managed by KIPA, known as Kythera Trails, which are listed on the website <a href='http://www.kytheratrails.gr'>www.kytheratrails.gr</a> . </p>
<p>If you encounter an issue outside of these trails, you should not report it through Fix My Kythera Trails, but instead get in touch with the relevant authorities directly. </p>
<p>The system will automatically reject reports located outside of the island of Kythera.</p>
<h2>4. Why has my report not been published?</h2>
<p>A report may be invalidated by the site administrators for any of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The report concerns something outside of the scope of Fix My Kythera Trails </li>
<li>The same issue has already been reported by someone else. You will be notified of the number of the reported incident so you can subscribe to it if you so wish.</li>

</ul>
<h2>5. Why have my pictures or comments not been published?</h2>

<h2>6. The automatic location proposed by Fix My Kythera Trails does not match the actual location.</h2>
<p>In some cases, the location proposed by Fix My Kythera Trails and the actual location of the incident do not match. Recommended solutions:</p>

</ul>
